# Configuration of Parsifal




## Use by Programmer

* **config.js** is included wherever we want to configure Javascript portions
* **config.php** is included wherever we want to configure php portions




## Adaptation by Maintainer

* **config-env.php** defines the environment variables used by Tex (not clear still how much we still need of this)

* **config-old.php** is phased out. It is no longer used.

* config-paths.php
